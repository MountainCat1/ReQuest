  - <Text>k__BackingField: Hm..? I suppose you're not a talktive type...
  - <Text>k__BackingField: I guess I will share some information with ya!
  - <Text>k__BackingField: East of here there are kobolds, those nasty pests always
      have something of value if you are interested.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: You can head west and you will arrive in the Ironvile
      - a small mining town.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: South? I would not go south. Bandits are patroling those
      roads, so I would stay away.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: That's all I have to say. So... don't bother me.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: Except if you have some good beverage... I would love
      some good beverage.
